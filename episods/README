Dumb script to watch TV series.

Dependencies
	mplayer (sudo apt-get install mplayer).
	osd_cat (for on screen display) (sudo apt-get install xosd-bin).

Install:
	sudo cp ./episods ./kill_mplayer /usr/local/bin
	sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/episods
	sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/kill_mplayer

	Then you should add a keyboard shortcut configured to run kill_mplayer (in my case I use CTRL+SHIFT+Q)
Usage:
	# To watch all Dexter episods from first to last:
	cd /mnt/series/Dexter
	episods
	# When you're done, just press CTRL+SHIFT+Q

	# To watch random episods of The Big Bang Theory:
	cd /mnt/series/TBBT
	episods rand
	# When you're done, just press CTRL+SHIFT+Q
